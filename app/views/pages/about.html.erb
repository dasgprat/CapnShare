	        <p style="text-align: justify;">We are a bunch of Oregon State University's students, pursuing our Master's in Computer Science, working towards preventing food wastage. This project is a part of our course work for CS 562: Software Project Management by Prof. Christopher Scaffidi. </p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">
	        It's a lesser-known fact that a third of the total food produced every year is wasted and we all have contributed to it, its not just the food industry. Our purpose of making this application is to encourage distribution of food items that may otherwise go to waste sitting somewhere in the kitchen cabinet or refrigerator. This is something that can be used by every one and especially work well in a university town like ours! Don't forget, 
	        </p>

	        <p style="text-align: center;"> <i>One man's trash is another man's treasure!</i> </p>

	        <p style="text-align: justify;"> Capâ€™nShare is a system where users can post pictures of the food items they
			would like to share with others. Interested people can mark the post and connect with the owner to collect it from them. Or, users can opt to drop off the food as per their convenience! Users can also donate their items to food shelters available near them.

	        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: x-small; ">Cap'nShare is not responsible for the quality of products shared via the website. We simply act as a platform to connect the ones who want to share with a number people who might be interested in their shared item.</p>
