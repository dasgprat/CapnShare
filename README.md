# CapnShare


Have you ever thrown out food just because you didn’t have time to eat and it
expired? Have you ever bought a whole kit of baking products to make a single
cake and never used it again? Got a lot of leftovers and don’t know what to do?
Leaving home for a week and got lots of food in the refrigerator? DON’T throw it
away. Share it with CAP’NSHARE!

            ***One man's trash is another man's treasure!***

Cap’nShare is a system where users can post pictures of the food items they
would like to share with others. Interested people can mark the post and connect
with the owner to collect it from them. Or, users can opt to drop off the food as
per their convenience! Users can also donate their items to food shelters
available near them.

The purpose of the application is to encourage distribution of food items that
may otherwise go to waste sitting somewhere in the kitchen cabinet or
refrigerator. This is something that can be used by every one and especially
work well in a university town like ours. Hence, there would not be any issue
gathering people to use this system. If time permits, team can also contact OSU
dining services to gather more users for the system.

If you are someone who would be interested to use this system or would like to
help build it, contact me for further details.
